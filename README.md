Subject: Clarification Regarding Dataset for "Project 5 Proposal Level-2" in Data Analytics Internship

Dear Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am currently working on the "Project 5 Proposal Level-2" for the Data Analytics internship, as provided by Oasis Infobyte. While implementing the project, I encountered a dataset-related issue.

The provided dataset link refers to a fraud detection dataset, which is not suitable for the autocomplete and autocorrect functionalities that are required for the project. I am reaching out to request clarification or guidance on whether a specific text-based dataset is available for this project, as I need relevant text data to work on the autocomplete and autocorrect algorithms.

If you could kindly provide the correct dataset or suggest an alternative dataset for text-based analysis, I would greatly appreciate it. Alternatively, if I need to proceed with a simplified approach using random sample text data, please let me know.

Thank you for your support and guidance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
